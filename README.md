# Atom Nightly Releases

Provides Atom Nightly Releases to be served by [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org)

### This is an experiment.

If you've found this repo, congratulations!  You are now privy to an experiment in providing nightly releases of Atom using the new Electron update service.

We are still evaluating whether nightly releases make sense for Atom, so don't get your hopes up just yet.  If you're interested in seeing this happen, please give feedback on the **[Atom Nightly Releases RFC](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17445)**!
